# Topical Chats

Author: Alessio Tamburro

Date: 05/05/2021

Status: Under development

The data used in this project is from https://github.com/alexa/Topical-Chat.

Objective:
We show how to use a sentence encoder to identify utterances where a speaker mentions "talking points", i.e. talks about a topic that is available from a prepared list of topics. We will also want to determine what language was more successful in the conversation and understand what level of "similarity" distance values between topics and utterances where these topics are used can be found in natural conversations.
